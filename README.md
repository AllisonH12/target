# Vision Optimization for Target Shooters

A specialized web application designed to help optometrists provide customized vision solutions for target shooters, particularly those with presbyopia.

## Overview

This application provides two main tools:

1. **Interactive Focus Simulator** - A visual tool that demonstrates how different vision correction options affect a shooter's sight picture. It allows adjustment of focus points, correction types, and simulates various shooting conditions.

2. **Prescription Report** - A professional report template for optometrists to provide specialized vision prescriptions for shooters, including detailed recommendations and adaptation protocols.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of sight picture with different vision corrections
- Simulation of various correction types (multifocal, single vision, monovision, bifocal)
- Adjustable focus points to demonstrate sight vs. target clarity
- Customizable parameters for add power, dominant eye, and lighting conditions
- Professional prescription report template

## Target Users

- Optometrists and vision care professionals who work with shooters
- Target shooters with presbyopia seeking specialized vision solutions
- Shooting coaches and instructors who want to understand vision considerations
